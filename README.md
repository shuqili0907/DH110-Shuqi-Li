## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation 
### About the project 
This project is about improving music learning websites with a target user group of middle-aged men. Music learning in this project is expected to be professional, including learning music theories, composition skills and practicing with certain instruments. However, with the target of learning professional skills, many websites are designed to be too complicated and not user-friendly for the middle-aged target group who may have bad eyesight and unfamiliarity with the internet. Thus, in this project I will try to improve the user expriences on professional music learning websites for middle-aged groups to develop an interest in music. 

## Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics 
1. Visibility of System Status: Users should be clearly informed about what is going on with the website and should be givin appropriate feedback. 
2. Match between system and the real world: Designers should use lanaguegs and concepts that are familiar to users rather than jargon. 
3. User control and freedom: Allow users to make mistakes and grant them options of Undo and Redo. 
4. Consistency and standards: Follow platform and industry conventions and make sure the design is consistent. 
5. Error prevention: Prevent users from error-prone conditions and high-cost errors. 
6. Recognition rather than recall: Minimize user's memory load by giving clear information and help in context 
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and allow useres to tailor frequent actions. 
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: Provide only the essential elements and information. 
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Give error messages that are explicitly explained in plain languages. 
10. Help and documentation: Provide extra help for users.
